# python-api-challange
This text outlines a set of requirements for a data analysis project using weather data obtained from the OpenWeatherMap API. The project has two main parts, and the first part involves creating scatter plots to showcase the relationships between latitude and different weather variables, such as temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed. For each relationship, a linear regression analysis is also required to determine if there is a significant correlation between the variables.

The second part of the project, called "VacationPy," involves using the city data obtained from the OpenWeatherMap API to create a map displaying the locations of different cities. The city data is then narrowed down to find the ideal weather conditions for a vacation, and the Geoapify API is used to find hotels located within 10,000 meters of the chosen coordinates. Finally, the hotel name and country are added as additional information in the hover message for each city on the map.

Overall, this project involves data collection and analysis using various APIs and data visualization tools, including scatter plots and maps. The different parts of the project build upon each other and require careful attention to detail and programming skills.
